                    This restaurant has been in business for over five years and run by a very energetic woman named Beth Cavanagh. It is definitely a family and friends run business. Many times you will see Beth joined by her two sons, Joey and Cam, in the kitchen. The restaurant prides iteself on being able to serve breakfast all day (from 6:30am to 2:30pm).  It also serves a variety of wonderful comfort foods, some even gluten free :)
